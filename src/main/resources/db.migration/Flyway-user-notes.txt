>> If you have any experience just add them to here:

If you want to change something on database you can not change those queries under flyway folder and related file anymore.
If you change something on queries that will throw exception :"Migration description mismatch for migration version .. "
** So:
- Need to drop db and create again.
- Create upper version of file not change file names or content itself

**If you want to change something on database please fallow naming convention: V26__create_tables.sql,V27__create_tables.sql
And your file with version and sql code. That is enough.

** If you have problem about database just right click over schema and DROP with CASCADE it.
